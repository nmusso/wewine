## How the design was done
- Initially we created some minimal mockups with the essential input interfaces 
- We recreated this mockups with some basic HTML and backend 
- We did an "experience prototyping" session with some external eterogeneous users (various age and computer knowledge) to evaluate the prototypes
- After collecting the results of the previous point we evoluted the initial mockups resolving all the reported problems
- We did a focus group with some target users (in our case, three sommeliers) to define accurately the domain and the terms to use
- In the end we started the develop
